# 3. Methodology


# 4. Quadcopter Mechanical Design and Software Setup 
- Look at "4. Nico_Prev_Thesis_Component_Selection_Info"
- Mention thrust and efficiency of selected motor
- 5" vs 7"
- Lidar vs RGB vs monocular vs stereo vs RGBD vs TOF
- INAV vs PX4 vs Ardupilot
- Design of different protective cages (mechanical fuse)

# 5. Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping 




# 6. Autonomous Path Planning 


# 7. Practical Testing and Validation 

	7.1 Hover Test and flight Test of Build
		- Software configurations


	7.2 Simulations
		- ROS2 and Gazebo compatibility
		7.2.1 Gazebo Harmonic for PX4
		
		7.2.2 Ignition Fortress for SLAM algorithm
			Control System of drone
			Implementation of SLAM algorithms
			
	

	7.3 Field Experiments





# 8. Conclusion and Future Work 







# Appendix A.......







# To sort in:
- Time of Flight (TOF) Calculator vs. actual
- Comparison between props (maybe also datasheet vs actual)
- Thrust to weight ratio
