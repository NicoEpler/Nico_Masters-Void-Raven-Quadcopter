# Abstract
# 1. Introduction
	1.1 Background


	1.2 Objectives


	1.3 Motivation


# 2. Literature Review


# 3. Quadcopter Construction / System Design
- Look at "4. Nico_Prev_Thesis_Component_Selection_Info"
- Mention thrust and efficiency of selected motor
- 5" vs 7"
- Liar vs RGB vs monocular vs stereo vs RGBD vs TOF
- INAV vs PX4 vs Ardupilot
- Design of different protective cages (mechanical fuse)

# 4. Autonomous Exploration and Mapping




# 5. Testing

	7.1 Hover Test and flight Test of Build
		- Software configurations


	7.2 Simulations
		- ROS2 and Gazebo compatibility
		7.2.1 Gazebo Harmonic for PX4
		
		7.2.2 Ignition Fortress for SLAM algorithm
			Control System of drone
			Implementation of SLAM algorithms
			
	

	7.3 Field Experiments





# 6. Results





# 7. Conclusions........



# Appendix A.......







# To sort in:
- Time of  Flight (TOF) Calculator vs. actual
- Comparison between props (maybe also datasheet vs actual)
- Thrust to weight ratio
