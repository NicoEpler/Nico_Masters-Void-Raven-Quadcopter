abstract = {Ground control is an integral element of mine design and worker safety. The use of concrete pillars for underground mines is of paramount importance to maintaining the economic and operational security of structures. This paper deals with the use of fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) as pillars via laboratory and field tests. The strength performance of prepared concrete reinforced with glass, polypropylene and polyacrylonitrile fibers was researched by a mechanical press and a computed tomography (CT) tool. Samples were tested for fiber volume fractions of 0, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 wt%, respectively. Results have indicated that, with the addition of fibers, the strength was improved first due to a bridging effect and then decreased due to a pull-out effect. Compared to the reference sample, the absorbed energy prevents FRC from deterioration by mechanisms of matrix cracking, fiber-matrix interface debonding and fiber rupture. The peak strains of FRC linearly rise with increasing fiber. The gray value distribution curves have also good correspondence with 2D CT pore and crack distributions, which reveal that gray value processing could depict the structural behavior of concretes reinforced with or without fiber. Theoretical analyses show that the pillar remains stable for sustainable mining. Besides, the location and size of FRC pillars are suitable for numerical calculations of the trial stope. The findings of this study can offer a key reference for the orebody pillar recovery in underground mines.}

   abstract = {The deterioration of mining conditions, the rising cost of labor, the limited potential of both humans and traditional mining machines and the lack of skilled workers are some of the reasons to consider robots in mining. Mining is the practice of extracting resources for utilitarian purposes. The new and developed machines used in mining must operate in harsh, dynamic and uncertain environmental conditions. Robotics technology have recently taken on an international favor and become a significant topic in engineering research. Robotics has a great potential for assisting in the complex task of extracting and processing minerals from the ground. Application of robotics in mining are broad and used in operations such as robotic mapping, surveying, excavation, transportation… This paper will provide an overview of the rapidly evolving fields of mining robotics. The development of new theories and techniques and the potential of both these fields in mine design and planning are examined. And there are many reasons to advance the discipline of mining robotics which include the improvement of productivity, safety and lower cost, this paper also discusses about labor problems and environmental sustainability in mining robotics.},

abstract = {Numerous underground mine accidents in the past worldwide highlight the importance and urgent need for safer, more effective, and more reliable mine safety procedures and regulations. Ensuring the safety of miners in underground mine environments is however an extremely challenging aspect of mining operations today, due to the highly non-uniform nature of mining, dynamic operation of the mines, co-existence of the miners and heavy machineries, and a multitude of risk factors such as mine explosions, fires, poisonous gases, cave-ins and flooding. In this paper, we present a comprehensive literature review on the research progress in using smart computing technologies to improve underground mine safety. In particular, we discuss state-of-the-art research in wireless sensor networks and robotics with a particular focus on improving underground mine safety. We present our understanding of the unique challenges in improving safety in underground mines and future research directions. The research described here can be applied to other underground environments such as human made tunnels, underground urban spaces, and natural cave systems.},

ABSTRACT = {A considerable number of coal mines employed room and pillar mining in the last century in northern China, where the goaf remained stable for a period of time; however, with the increased exposure of coal pillars, their collapse may gradually increase. The stability assessment of these old rooms and pillar goafs is challenging due to their concealment, irregular mining patterns, and the long passage of time. The methodology developed in this study, based on “space-sky-earth” remote sensing such as InSAR to trace historical deformation, the UAV observation of current surface damage, and comparison of mining spaces, can rapidly detect on a large scale the collapse of old goafs and the trend of damage. This study is conducted with an example of a coal mine in Yulin, Northern China, where obtained quantitative surface deformation values were integrated with qualitative surface damage interpretation results, followed by a yearly analysis of the overlying rock movement in accordance with the underground coal mining process. The results show that from 2007 to 2021, corresponding surface deformation and damage occurred following mining progress. However, the room and pillar goaf areas had not undergone any surface deformation, nor had there been incidents of landslides or ground fissures; therefore, it was speculated that no roof collapse had occurred in this region. The surface deformation and damage associated with underground coal mining are complex and influenced by the coal seam occurrence, mining methods, strata lithology, terrain slope, temporal evolution, and anthropogenic modifications. These phenomena are representative of the coal mining area, and this methodology can provide a reference for similar endeavors.},

abstract = {At present there is a lack of an instrument to measure the trajectory of up-holes in a safe and efficient way with minor disruption of underground production. To overcome this, a mechanically operated probe equipped with Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and centralisers is integrated in an explosive charge-up unit, which allows the operator to start and stop the measurements from a safe area, while he views the records in real time in a handheld PC. The system incorporates a real-time quality indicator based in the 95% confidence standard deviational ellipse (SDE) of the toe’s positions that clearly indicates whether the survey should be repeated before moving to the next blasthole to ensure measurements with limited uncertainty. In-field data shows an accuracy and repeatability between measurements below 1.3 cm/m, which ensures detecting drilling errors in production rings, often of amount to several tens of centimetres, that may compromise blast results.}
