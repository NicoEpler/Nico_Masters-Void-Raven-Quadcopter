# 1. Creating nodes and a launch file:

## 1.1. Creating nodes:

1. Follow installation in 1. Drone Simulation(Humble PX4)
	1. Instead of installing in home, install px4_offboard in ros2_ws/src/
2. Create package:
```Shell
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
ros2 pkg create voidraven_offboard --build-type ament_python
```
1. Create Nodes (this code creates 4):
```Shell
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/voidraven_offboard/voidraven_offboard
touch position_control.py
chmod +x position_control.py
touch position_command_input.py
chmod +x position_command_input.py
touch terminal_launches.py
chmod +x terminal_launches.py
touch visualizer.py
chmod +x visualizer.py
```
1. Open the individual nodes files and write code to them
2. Update the `setup.py` file:
```Python
from setuptools import find_packages, setup
  
package_name = 'voidraven_offboard'
  
setup(
	name=package_name,
	version='0.0.0',
	packages=find_packages(exclude=['test']),
	data_files=[
		('share/ament_index/resource_index/packages',
		['resource/' + package_name]),
		('share/' + package_name, ['package.xml']),
	],
	install_requires=['setuptools'],
	zip_safe=True,
	maintainer='nico',
	maintainer_email='23910712@sun.ac.za',
	description='TODO: Package description',
	license='TODO: License declaration',
	# tests_require=['pytest'],
	entry_points={
		'console_scripts': [
			'position_command_input = voidraven_offboard.position_command_input:main',#Add this line
			'position_control = voidraven_offboard.position_control:main',#Add this line
			'visualizer = voidraven_offboard.visualizer:main',#Add this line
			'terminal_launches = voidraven_offboard.terminal_launches:main',#Add this line
		],
	},
)
```
1. build the package (NOTE!!! when using --symlink-install flag, I got warning, delete build and install files and run again, without symlink-install flag):
```Shell
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select voidraven_offboard
source install/setup.bash
```
1. To run individual node, run one of the following lines:
```Shell
ros2 run voidraven_offboard position_command_input
ros2 run voidraven_offboard position_control
ros2 run voidraven_offboard visualizer
ros2 run voidraven_offboard terminal_launches
```

## 1.2. Creating and running launch file:

1. Create launch file:
```Shell
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/voidraven_offboard
mkdir launch
touch launch/offboard_launch.py
chmod +x launch/offboard_launch.py
```
1. Edit code in offboard_launch.py file
2. Update following lines in setup.py file
```Python
from setuptools import find_packages, setup
from glob import glob #Add this line


	data_files=[
		('share/ament_index/resource_index/packages',
		['resource/' + package_name]),
		('share/' + package_name, ['package.xml']),
		('share/' + package_name + '/launch', glob('launch/*.py')), #Add this line
	],
```
1. colcon build package
```Shell
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select voidraven_offboard
source install/setup.bash
```
1. Launch the launch file using:
```Shell
ros2 launch voidraven_offboard offboard_launch.py
```


## 1.3. To Add bridge for point cloud visualization

1. In "/home/nico/ros2_ws/src/voidraven_offboard/resource" create file called "ros_gz_bridge.yaml" and make executable. Add following content:
```Shell
---
# Nico_X500_bridges
  
- ros_topic_name: "/clock"
gz_topic_name: "/clock"
ros_type_name: "rosgraph_msgs/msg/Clock"
gz_type_name: "gz.msgs.Clock"
direction: GZ_TO_ROS
  
- ros_topic_name: "/camera"
gz_topic_name: "/camera"
ros_type_name: "sensor_msgs/msg/Image"
gz_type_name: "gz.msgs.Image"
direction: GZ_TO_ROS

- ros_topic_name: "/depth_camera"
gz_topic_name: "/depth_camera"
ros_type_name: "sensor_msgs/msg/Image"
gz_type_name: "gz.msgs.Image"
direction: GZ_TO_ROS

- ros_topic_name: "/depth_camera/points"
gz_topic_name: "/depth_camera/points"
ros_type_name: "sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2"
gz_type_name: "gz.msgs.PointCloudPacked"
direction: GZ_TO_ROS
```
1.  Add the following to /home/nico/ros2_ws/src/voidraven_offboard/package.xml file:
```shell
<depend>ros_gz</depend>
<depend>ros_gz_bridge</depend>
```
1.  Add the following to /home/nico/ros2_ws/src/voidraven_offboard/setup.py file:
```shell
('share' + package_name + '/resouce', glob('ros_gz_bridge/*.yaml')),
```
1. Install ros_gz dependencies following [this link](https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/tree/humble). Use the "From source" installation as follows:
```Shell
export GZ_VERSION=garden # IMPORTANT: Replace with correct version

# Setup the workspace
cd ~/ros2_ws/src

# Download needed software
git clone https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz.git -b humble

cd ~/ros2_ws
rosdep install -r --from-paths src -i -y --rosdistro humble

# Source ROS distro's setup.bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

# Build and install into workspace
cd ~/ros2_ws
#colcon build --parallel-workers=3
colcon build --packages-skip ros_gz_image --parallel-workers 3
```
1. If PC freezes, after restart enter following in terminal : export GZ_VERSION=garden
		1. Try building individual packages/skipping packages/skipping packages that have been build previously/ process less packages simultaneously according to following [link](https://get-help.theconstruct.ai/t/colcon-build-crashes-ubuntu-22-04/19558) and this [link](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/reference/package-selection-arguments.html) 
		2. couldn't get ros_gz_image to build
2. This sometimes gives problems. Make sure to:
		3. Run following command
```Bash 
pip install setuptools==58.2.0
```
1. Troubleshooting:
	1. If you get launch error "ERROR gz_bridge] Service call timed out." Check out [Link 1](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/20668) and [Link 2](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/22148)
	2. Sometimes Gazebo struggles to run/fails. Then close VSCode. It sometimes causes problems


Either open new terminal and run
```shell
ros2 run ros_gz_bridge parameter_bridge --ros-args -p config_file:=/home/nico/ros2_ws/src/voidraven_offboard/resource/ros_gz_bridge.yaml
```
OR from launch file:

1. Add following node to launch file:
```shell
# Bridge ROS topics and Gazebo messages for establishing communication
Node(
package='ros_gz_bridge',
executable='parameter_bridge',
parameters=[{
'config_file': os.path.join(yaml_file_path, 'ros_gz_bridge.yaml'),
'qos_overrides./tf_static.publisher.durability': 'transient_local',
'use_sim_time': True,
}],
output='screen'
)
```


## 1.4. To Add Custom Models

1.  Add folder with model name (e.g. my_model) to "/home/nico/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/simulation/gz/models"
2. Inside my_model folder, add files: 
	1. model.config
	2. model.sdf (In this folder you can change most parameters)
3. Create an airframe file in "/home/nico/PX4-Autopilot/ROMFS/px4fmu_common/init.d-posix/airframes"
	1. give it an unassigned number and call it: 4012_gz_my_model
	2. Also contains some important parameters
4. Add the new airframe name to "CMakeLists.txt" file in "/home/nico/PX4-Autopilot/ROMFS/px4fmu_common/init.d-posix/airframes"
5. Now you can launch it using:
```Shell
cd PX4-Autopilot/
make px4_sitl gz_my_model
```
1. NOTE! Iris Quadcopter sdf model can be obtained from [PX4-SITL_gazebo-classic](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-SITL_gazebo-classic) 
	1. Copy Iris folder and Iris_opt_flow folder
	2. rename containing files to "model.sdf"
		1. In Iris model and airframe file, make sure its similar to x500(since this works in gazebo sim)
		2. Do lots of changes, to match the layout of x500
		3. Also change "-commandSubTopic>/gazebo/command/motor_speed</commandSubTopic" to "commandSubTopic>command/motor_speed</commandSubTopic"

## 1.5. To Add bridge for Other GZ_SIM topics

1. List topics using:
```shell
gz topic -l
```
1. Info on  topics using:
```shell
gz topic -i -t /topic
```
1. topic conversions can be found [Here](https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/tree/ros2/ros_gz_bridge) 
2. Add code to "/home/nico/ros2_ws/src/voidraven_offboard/resource" create file called "ros_gz_bridge.yaml" as follows:
```shell
- ros_topic_name: "/optical_flow_cam_info"
gz_topic_name: "/world/default/model/x500_depth_0/link/flow_link/sensor/flow_camera/camera_info"
ros_type_name: "sensor_msgs/msg/CameraInfo"
gz_type_name: "gz.msgs.CameraInfo"
direction: GZ_TO_ROS

- ros_topic_name: "/optical_flow_cam_img"
gz_topic_name: "/world/default/model/x500_depth_0/link/flow_link/sensor/flow_camera/image"
ros_type_name: "sensor_msgs/msg/Image"
gz_type_name: "gz.msgs.Image"
direction: GZ_TO_ROS

- ros_topic_name: "/camera_info"
gz_topic_name: "/camera_info"
ros_type_name: "sensor_msgs/msg/CameraInfo"
gz_type_name: "gz.msgs.CameraInfo"
direction: GZ_TO_ROS

- ros_topic_name: "/camera_info"
gz_topic_name: "/world/default/model/x500_depth_0/link/flow_link/sensor/flow_camera/camera_info"
ros_type_name: "sensor_msgs/msg/CameraInfo"
gz_type_name: "gz.msgs.CameraInfo"
direction: GZ_TO_ROS
```





# 2. Node Descriptions and info

## 2.1. position_control
1. performs actual position control
	1. Responds to position and orientation data published to /offboard_position_cmd topic and takes drone there
2. NOTE: Have to set `MIS_TAKEOFF_ALT` in QGC (I think)
	1. Can also be set in this code, but I dont think that works
3. CHANGES done to original code [ARK-Electronics code](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git --recursive -b release/1.14) 
	1. Changed control mode from velocity to position
	2. Change trigger for going into loiter and offboard mode (worked in sim, but not on actual drone, would never switch to loiter or offboard mode)
	3. Add reading from /fmu/in/vehicle_odometry ros2 topic
	4. Change takeoff altitude
	5. TODO:
		1. Check if takeoff altitude is from code or QGC [Done]
			1. If altitude from code, change altitude, such that it reads initial z altitude and then sets takeoff altitude to initial + 1.8m[Done]
				1. ---Nope takeoff altitude only to be defined in QGC (I think) [Done]
			2. set altitude at which quad changes to offboard mode to initial z + 1.5m: Then actually dont need to specify takeoff altitude [Done]
		2. remove PI from position control. might only do the spin in sim [Done]
		3. change `position_publish_node` so that it only increments by 0.1m, instead of 0.5 adn turning by 0.2[Done]
		4. change in code, that once the desired altitude is reached, its current position is published to  /offboard_position_cmd and only then does it switch to offboard mode [Done]
		5. make code more custom and make nice

## 2.2. position_publish_node
1. can be used to sent setpoint positions to /offboard_position_cmd ros2 topic, for quadcopter to move to
2. TODO:
	1. Change code, such that it reads /offboard_position_cmd topic, then increments, so that I can have multiple publishers [Done]

## 2.3. Difference between Sim to Real
1. In sim, all works well, in real quad never changes to loiter/offboard in small room, before crashing
2. After changing to position mode, in simquad randomly rotates 90* deg in beginning, in real???????????????????????????????????????
3. 



# 3. Testing Launch File in Simulator
1. colcon build package
```Shell
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select voidraven_offboard
source install/setup.bash
```
1. Launch the launch file using:
```Shell
ros2 launch voidraven_offboard offboard_launch.py
```
1. If gazebo does not close, run:
```Shell
pkill -f px4
pkill -f gzserver
pkill -f gzclient
```


# 4. Testing Launch File on real quadcopter:


1. ssh into quad
```Shell
ssh dronepi@192.168.137.50
ssh khadas@192.168.137.68 (VIM on Wootbook Network)
ssh khadas@192.168.68.102 (VIM on VoidRaven Network)
```

1. start nodes for VIM to connect to FC
```Shell
sudo MicroXRCEAgent serial --dev /dev/ttyS4 -b 921600 (VIM)
```

1. start position_control
```Shell
ros2 run voidraven_offboard position_control
```
1. start position_command_input
```Shell
ros2 run voidraven_offboard position_command_input
```

1. Test results:
	1. When using topic subscription, to much latency over network


























# Launch Command

7. REMEMBER: Rebuild px4_offboard every time we make changes to the code. Use the following command for rebuild and launch:
```Shell
cd
cd ros2_px4_workspace_Nico/
colcon build --packages-select px4_offboard
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch px4_offboard offboard_velocity_control.launch.py
```

Launch PX4 only
```Shell
cd && cd ~/PX4-Autopilot &&  HEADLESS=1 PX4_GZ_WORLD=default PX4_GZ_MODEL_POSE='-13,0,0,0,0,0' PX4_SIM_MODEL=gz_x500_depth ./build/px4_sitl_default/bin/px4
```

Launch Gazebo world only:
```Shell
gz sim /home/nuc/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/simulation/gz/worlds/default.sdf
```

Kill Gazebo and all its processes:
```Shell
pkill -9 ruby  
unset GZ_IP  
unset GZ_PARTITION
```

To see all current transforms:
```Shell
ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames
```
To see a graph of all running topics and nodes:
```Shell
rqt_graph
```



# How To Start:

1. Clone github repo into "home" folder
2. Build the environment:
```Shell
cd
cd ros2_px4_workspace_N/
colcon build
```

3. Open "/home/nuc/ros2_px4_workspace_N/src/ROS2_PX4_Offboard_Example/px4_offboard" in VS code. Some directory names will have to be changed, according to your devices name, including:
```Shell
aml_file_path = '/home/nuc/ros2_px4_workspace_N/src/ROS2_PX4_Offboard_Example/px4_offboard/resource'
load_sdf_path = '/home/nuc/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/simulation/gz'
urdf_dir = '/home/nuc/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/simulation/gz/models/x500_depth'
```
