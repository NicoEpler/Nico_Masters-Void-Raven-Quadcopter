1. Test SpectacularAi example from [here](https://github.com/SpectacularAI/sdk-examples/tree/main/python/oak/ros2)
	1. NOTE: pip install spectacularAI does not work for arm64. 
	2. For arm64, packages have to specially be requested from SpectacularAI, and may not be used in industry. Requested repository can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CkfK5594vkrYop7BzxzaZOn2bspNcvVg/view) 

# 1. Installing SpectacularAI (Khadas Vim4 (aarch64))

1. Follow [this](obsidian://open?vault=Nuc_Obsidian_Vault&file=2.3.%20Testing%20OAK-D%20Pro%20W%20RGBD%20CAM) link to install oak-d stuff

## 1.1. Installing and Running SpectacularAI_depthaiPlugin_Python VIO

To install spectacularAI_depthaiPlugin_Python VIO and Mapping Stuff (Follow readme file from downloaded folder)

2. Create workspace folder called SpecAI_depthAI_Project
3. Open this workspace diretory in terminal
4. create virtual environment (Dont need to do this. maybe just install globally/on device, else the mapping gives problems. I think the ros2 folder is supposed to be put inside the virtual environment folder):
```Shell
	python3 -m venv spectacularai_env
	source spectacularai_env/bin/activate
```
5. check python version (need this for selecting correct plugin installation)
```Shell
python --version
```
6. Move content from downloaded spectacularAI_depthaiPlugin_Python_1.37.0_aarch64 folder into workspace
7. Install the plugin from the workspace directory (Following the readme file from downloaded folder)
```Shell
pip install wheels/spectacularAI-1.37.0-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_17_aarch64.manylinux2014_aarch64.whl
```
8. Then also run the following:
```Shell
pip install spectacularAI[full]
```
9. Install dependencies:
```Shell
pip install matplotlib
```
10. Attach OAK-D Device
11. Run Example:
```Shell
cd
cd SpecAI_depthAI_Project
source spectacularai_env/bin/activate
python examples/vio_visu.py
```


## 1.2. Adding ROS2 Mapping

NOTE: I took the ros2 folder and put it inside the SpecAI_depthAI_Project workspace folder. I think if you use a virtual environment, the folder might have to be placed inside it. else it did not work.
12. Install opencv:
```Shell
pip install opencv-python
pip install spectacularAI[full]
```
13. Build Mapping Example:
```Shell
cd
cd SpecAI_depthAI_Project
cd ros2
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch launch/mapping.py
```
14. Launch Mapping program:
```Shell
cd
cd SpecAI_depthAI_Project
cd ros2
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch launch/mapping.py
```


# 2. Installing SpectacularAI (AMD64)

1. clone [SpectacularAI](https://github.com/SpectacularAI/sdk-examples/tree/main) and unzip
2. copy the folder to Home
3. Then run the code
```Shell
pip install spectacularAI[full]
cd
cd SpectacularAI_sdk-examples-main/sdk-examples-main/python/oak/ros2
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch launch/mapping.py
```
1. Rebuild using:
```Shell
cd
cd SpectacularAI_sdk-examples-main/sdk-examples-main/python/oak/ros2
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```
1. Launch using
```Shell
cd
cd SpectacularAI_sdk-examples-main/sdk-examples-main/python/oak/ros2
ros2 launch launch/mapping.py
```
1. For changing code and including open3d and testing installation, run:
```Shell
pip install open3d
python -c "import open3d; print(open3d.__version__)"
```


## 3. Modifying the SpectacularAI code a bit

Read through [this documentation](https://spectacularai.github.io/docs/sdk/wrappers/oak.html#spectacularAI.depthai.Session) 
2. Changes done to "publishPointCloud" function(more precise term is method) in "ros2_node.py"
	1. Added code to convert pointcloud to Open3D pointcloud object
	2. perform voxel downsampling
		1. Decided to use voxel_downsample
		2. Instead ofuniform_down_sample - downsample the point cloud by collecting every n-th points.
	3. Perform Outlier removal
		1. Decided to use radius_outlier_removal - removes points that have few neighbors in a given sphere around them
			1. nb_points (specific number of ponts needed)
			2. radius (in specified radius)
	4. Convert the filtered Open3D PointCloud back to numpy array
3. Changed VIO Frequency by adding following code:
```Shell
changed_fps = 20 # Nico: I added this line Changes VIO framerate (Default=30)
self.vio_pipeline.monoLeft.setFps(changed_fps) # Nico: I added this line
self.vio_pipeline.monoRight.setFps(changed_fps) # Nico: I added this line
```
4. ToDo:
	1. Voxelise again and convert to ros2 topic of type "MarkerArray"
	2. Change pointcloud frequency????






# Mapping Test

5. ssh into quad
```
ssh dronepi@192.168.137.50
ssh khadas@192.168.137.68 (VIM on Wootbook Network)
ssh khadas@192.168.68.102 (VIM on VoidRaven Network)
```
6. start nodes for pi to connect to FC
```Shell
sudo MicroXRCEAgent serial --dev /dev/ttyS4 -b 921600 (VIM)
```
7. Mount SD Card
```Shell
#Mounting and giving permissions to user
sudo mount -o uid=$(id -u),gid=$(id -g),umask=0022 /dev/mmcblk1p1 /home/khadas/SDCardMount
cd SDCardMount/
mkdir Rosbag20250215
cd Rosbag20250215/
```
8. Start SpecAI Mapping
```Shell
cd
cd SpecAI_depthAI_Project
cd ros2
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch launch/mapping.py
```
9. Start Rosbag Recording
```Shell
mkdir Rosbagrec
cd Rosbagrec
ros2 bag record -a -o Test1
```
10. Move Recording to SD Card
```Shell
#Transferring rosbag, if manually mounted SD card
mv Rosbagrec/Test1 SDCardMount/Rosbag20250215

#Transferring rosbag, if Monitor connected and auto mount sd card
mv Rosbag/Test1 /media/khadas/1604-2516/Rosbagrec
```
