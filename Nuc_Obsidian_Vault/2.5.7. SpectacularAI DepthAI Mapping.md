1. Test SpectacularAi example from [here](https://github.com/SpectacularAI/sdk-examples/tree/main/python/oak/ros2)
	1. NOTE: pip install spectacularAI does not work for arm64. 
	2. For arm64, packages have to specially be requested from SpectacularAI, and may not be used in industry. Requested repository can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CkfK5594vkrYop7BzxzaZOn2bspNcvVg/view) 
2. More information on SpectacularAI SLAM algorithms:
	1. [This repo](https://github.com/SpectacularAI/SLAM-module/tree/main) mainly code, not much desciption
		1. Confirm the following, but looks correct:
			1. VIO - Sliding Window Optimization, IMU Pre-Integration and Nonlinear Optimization/Factor Graph Formulation (similar to ORB-SLAM2)
			2. SLAM Module based on OpenVSLAM- Has potential copyright infringement with ORB-SLAM2. For more info check [this link](https://github.com/xdspacelab/openvslam/wiki/Termination-of-the-release)

# 1. Installing SpectacularAI (Khadas Vim4 (aarch64))

3. Follow [this](obsidian://open?vault=Nuc_Obsidian_Vault&file=2.3.%20Testing%20OAK-D%20Pro%20W%20RGBD%20CAM) link to install oak-d stuff

## 1.1. Installing and Running SpectacularAI_depthaiPlugin_Python VIO

To install spectacularAI_depthaiPlugin_Python VIO and Mapping Stuff (Follow readme file from downloaded folder)

4. Create workspace folder called SpecAI_depthAI_Project
5. Open this workspace diretory in terminal
6. create virtual environment (Dont need to do this. maybe just install globally/on device, else the mapping gives problems. I think the ros2 folder is supposed to be put inside the virtual environment folder):
```Shell
	python3 -m venv spectacularai_env
	source spectacularai_env/bin/activate
```
7. check python version (need this for selecting correct plugin installation)
```Shell
python --version
```
8. Move content from downloaded spectacularAI_depthaiPlugin_Python_1.37.0_aarch64 folder into workspace
9. Install the plugin from the workspace directory (Following the readme file from downloaded folder)
```Shell
pip install wheels/spectacularAI-1.37.0-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_17_aarch64.manylinux2014_aarch64.whl
```
10. Then also run the following:
```Shell
pip install spectacularAI[full]
```
11. Install dependencies:
```Shell
pip install matplotlib
```
12. Attach OAK-D Device
13. Run Example:
```Shell
cd
cd SpecAI_depthAI_Project
source spectacularai_env/bin/activate
python examples/vio_visu.py
```


## 1.2. Adding ROS2 Mapping

NOTE: I took the ros2 folder and put it inside the SpecAI_depthAI_Project workspace folder. I think if you use a virtual environment, the folder might have to be placed inside it. else it did not work.
14. Install opencv:
```Shell
pip install opencv-python
pip install spectacularAI[full]
```
15. Build Mapping Example:
```Shell
cd
cd SpecAI_depthAI_Project
cd ros2
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch launch/mapping.py
```
16. Launch Mapping program:
```Shell
cd
cd SpecAI_depthAI_Project
cd ros2
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch launch/mapping.py
```


# 2. Installing SpectacularAI (AMD64)

17. clone [SpectacularAI](https://github.com/SpectacularAI/sdk-examples/tree/main) and unzip
18. copy the folder to Home
19. Then run the code
```Shell
pip install spectacularAI[full]
cd
cd SpectacularAI_sdk-examples-main/sdk-examples-main/python/oak/ros2
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch launch/mapping.py
```

ros2 launch launch/mapping.py
```
1. For changing code and including open3d and testing installation, run:
```Shell
pip install open3d
python -c "import open3d; print(open3d.__version__)"
```


## 3. Modifying the SpectacularAI code a bit

Read through [this documentation](https://spectacularai.github.io/docs/sdk/wrappers/oak.html#spectacularAI.depthai.Session)

>>>>>>> 9b8855fc146089b6177941af0e3e4356cdfa1e75
	1. Added code to convert pointcloud to Open3D pointcloud object
	2. perform voxel downsampling
		1. Decided to use voxel_downsample
		2. Instead ofuniform_down_sample - downsample the point cloud by collecting every n-th points.
	3. Perform Outlier removal
		1. Decided to use radius_outlier_removal - removes points that have few neighbors in a given sphere around them
			1. nb_points (specific number of ponts needed)
			2. radius (in specified radius)
	4. Convert the filtered Open3D PointCloud back to numpy array
