# Simulations:

1. [Cartographer SLAM with ROS 2 in SITL](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/ros2-cartographer-slam.html) Looks like entire sim from ardupilot using cartographer slam
2. Gazebo Classic:
	1. This Kit provides an end to end simulation solution for MAV visual SLAM (or path planning) researches.
		In this work, several features are added to the default PX4 Gazebo Simulator:
		-A realsense D435 model (based on realsense_gazebo_plugin)
		-Modified IRIS MAV model
		-Several structured/unstructured simulation world
		The work has been verified on Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 + ROS melodic/noetic environment

3. (USES ROS1!!!! But looking very good) XTDrone is a UAV simulation platform based on PX4, ROS and Gazebo. XTDrone supports mulitrotors (including quadrotors and hexarotors), fixed wings, VTOLs (including quadplanes, tailsitters and tiltrotors) and other unmanned systems (such as UGVs, USVs and robotic arms). It's convenient to deploy the algorithm to real UAVs after testing and debugging on the simulation platform.

# Other interesting Stuff:

1. Highly interesting Jaeyoung-Lim stuff :
	1. [Obstacle Detection and Avoidance](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Avoidance):
		PX4 computer vision algorithms packaged as ROS nodes for depth sensor fusion and obstacle avoidance. This repository contains three different implementations:
		- _local_planner_ is a local VFH+* based planner that plans (including some history) in a vector field histogram
		- _global_planner_ is a global, graph based planner that plans in a traditional octomap occupancy grid
		- _safe_landing_planner_ is a local planner to find safe area to land
