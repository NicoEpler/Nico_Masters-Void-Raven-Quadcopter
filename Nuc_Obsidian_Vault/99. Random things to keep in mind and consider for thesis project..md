1. I'm designing for fast mapping, low computational cost and low financial cost
2. Aiding husky in underground exploration 
	1. If mine alone works very well, pivot to individual exploration, but lets see
	2. If mine alone performs worse than expected, maybe pivot into very short exploration missions for husky
3. If I'm designing for fast mapping and have short missions:
	1. Loop closure (highly dependent on feature detection)(Also very important/critical for reducing/eliminating sensor drift from sensors like IMU, etc. [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saVZtgPyyJQ&ab_channel=MATLAB)), might not be necessary, as there wont be much drift on short missions. Lets see!
4. Consider this thesis a full stack system development focusing on the complete, basic design for basic functionality for a quadcopter for underground mine mapping
	1. Should be the development of a functional prototype
	2. Where future work can focus on upgrading of specific subsystems of the quadrotor
	3. This research is supposed to give a good baseline and base model for future students, to provide them with a research platform, for which individual subsystems can later be upgraded and improved
	4. A modular approach makes sure that the system is easy to understand and future work can easily be implemented
