# Offboard Flow Control Diagram
1. Create diagram showing what offboard commands are sent to what px4 topic.
	1. Interesting overview/ demonstration of what I want this to look like can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeiHbkxyFUg&ab_channel=DennisBaldwin) 
	2. The above link also gives a good overview of some of the features of offboard control mode


# Optical Flow implementation

6. [Some tuning and calibration](https://discuss.cubepilot.org/t/has-anyone-successfully-used-hereflow-to-achieve-stable-indoor-positioning/12158) 
7. Nico Actual configuration:
	1. UAVCAN_ENABLE = 2 [(Sensors Automatic Config)] (if you have have UAVCAN sensors but no motor controllers)(Specific to HereFlow Optical Flow Sensor)
	2. EKF2_AID_MASK = 2 [Cant be changed. Change following instead]:
		1. EKF2_GPS_CTRL = 0 [Before = 1]
		2. EKF2_OF_CTRL = 1 [Enable] 
		3. EKF2_IMU_CTRL = 7 [Before = 3] 
		4. EKF2_EV_CTRL = 0 [Enable] 
		5. EKF2_EV_CTRL = 0 [Enable] 
		6. EKF2_DRAG_CTRL = 0 [Enable] 
		7. EKF2_EV_CTRL = 0 [Enable] 
		8. EKF2_GPS_CTRL = 0 [Enable] 
		9. EKF2_EV_CTRL = 0 [Enable] 
	3. If optical flow offset from centre, use (position of optical flow focal point in body frame (default is 0.0m)):
		1. EKF2_OF_POS_X = 0
		2. EKF2_OF_POS_Y = 0
		3. EKF2_OF_POS_Z = 0
	4. EKF2_HGT_MODE = Range Sensor [Does not exist]
	5. EKF2_HGT_REF = Range Sensor [Before = Barometric Pressure]
	6. SENS_FLOW_MINHGT = 0 (Not necessary) [Does not exist]
	7. MAYBE_   CBRK_GPSFAIL: 240024 (ignoring GPS) [Does not exist]
	8. EKF2_RNG_CTRL = Enabled (conditional mode) 
	9. UAVCAN_SUB_FLOW = Enable
	10. UAVCAN_SUB_RNG= Enable
8. To test if Optical Flow Sensor and Lidar works:
	1. MAVLink Inspector, you should be able to see:
		1. DISTANCE_SENSOR
		2. OPTICAL_FLOW_RAD
9. EKF2 Outputs:
	1. Attitude output data is found in the [vehicle_attitude]message.
	2. Local position output data is found in the [vehicle_local_position] message.
	3. Global (WGS-84) output data is found in the [vehicle_global_position] message.
	4. Wind velocity output data is found in the [wind_estimate] message.
10. MAVLink Console checks:
	1. List all topics: ls /obj
	2. listener vehicle_local_position
	3. listener vehicle_attitude
	4. sensors status

# Position mode flight test
1. TEST 1(Home): moves a bit and then overcompensates
	1. Change EKF2_OF_POS_Z = 0.062m
	2. Did Level Horizon Sensor calibration
	3. Did Gyroscope Sensor calibration
2. TEST 2(Home): A bit better, but still overcompensates a bit and struggles a lot at low altitude
	1. Check out Position mode PID controls
	2. Maybe add a led at bottom, if too dark
	3. Recalibrate accelerometer
3. TEST 3(LAB): Test at lab, very good lighting. Drone behaved very weirdly and unpredictable
	1. Calibrated all sensors
4. TEST 4(LAB): Test went very well.
	1. Check message I sent to Callen
5. NOTE: TEST IN DARK ROOM WITH LED ATACHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6. NOTE: CHECK IF I CAN DO OF AND LIDAR SENSOR CALIBRATION

# Altitude control flight test

1. Test 1(LAB): Test went well
	1. See message I sent to callen
2. NOTE: TEST MAX ALTITUDE. DOES IT BECOME PROBLEM WHEN REACHING LIDAR MAX?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
