1. Use serial port setup, which can be found [here](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/companion_computer/pixhawk_companion.html) or direct to jumpers like it was done with the [RaspsberryPi](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/companion_computer/pixhawk_rpi.html)
		1. Might  need USB to Serial breakout board:

		2. OR: Connect directly to companion
	1. Decide to use either MAVLink or  uXRCE-DDS between companion and Flight controller (First thought = MAVLink: Seems simpler to implement)
	2. PX4 expects companion computers to connect via TELEM2 for offboard control. The port is configured by default to interface using MAVLink
	3. To use [ROS 2/uXRCE-DDS](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/ros/ros2_comm.html) instead of MAVLink on `TELEM2`, disable MAVLink on the port and then enable the uXRCE-DDS client on `TELEM2`

# Getting The RGBD Camera to work
1. Follow steps on [this website](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros/tree/ros2-development). Follow the following:
	1. Step 1 : ROS2 Humble
	2. Step 2: Option 1: Install librealsense2 debian package from Intel servers
		1. Otherwise, install from [Linux Debian Installation Guide](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/doc/distribution_linux.md#installing-the-packages)
	3. Step 3: Option 1: Install debian package from ROS servers 
2. Test the camera using the following command:
```Shell
realsense-viewer
```
3. Starting a ROS2 camera node:
```Shell
ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py
ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py depth_module.depth_profile:=1280x720x30 pointcloud.enable:=true
```

4. To record a Rosbag:
	1. Open a terminal and directory where rosbag should be saved and run the following code
```Shell
cd
cd Rosbagrec
ros2 bag record -o filename1 --all
```

5. To replay rosbag:
	1. Open Terminal with RVIZ
	2. Open Specific RVIZ config file
	3. Replay the specific rosbag using the following prompt:

```Shell
cd
cd Rosbagrec
ros2 bag play rosbag2_2024_08_07-13_51_12/
```
