# 1. Convert 3D Octomap to 2D occupancy grid 

## 1.1. RTABMap Occupancy Grid (Roof Problem)
1. problem with roof, making occupancy grid seem occupied)
2. Strategy:
	1. Take pointcloud
	2. remove roof
	3. create occupancy grid
3. Better strategy:
	1. Instead of struggling with this, found repo to do this for me. Explained in "1.2. 3D Voxel Map to 2D Occupancy Map Conversion Using Free Space Representation:"

## 1.2. 3D Voxel Map to 2D Occupancy Map Conversion Using Free Space Representation:
1. Using https://github.com/LTU-RAI/Map-Conversion-3D-Voxel-Map-to-2D-Occupancy-Map  separated roof, creates 2D map for UAV or UGV... Maybe look at paper+
	1. This gives a good 2D occupancy grid
	2. NB!!! consider changing code to make more lightweight
		1. remove slopeMap
		2. remove UGV map
	3. NOTE!!! **assumes only one level of navigable space in the map in the height axis**
2. Build and install using (folder is called Map-Conversion-3D-Voxel-Map-to-2D-Occupancy-Map in workspace src):
```
cd
cd ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/LTU-RAI/Map-Conversion-3D-Voxel-Map-to-2D-Occupancy-Map.git
cd ..
colcon build --packages-select mapconversion_msgs
colcon build --packages-select mapconversion
source install/setup.bash
```
3. Small changes:
	1. Changed topic names
	2. small change in path_conversion.launch.py launch file wrong "}"
	3. Problem with dynamic nature of the probabilistic occupancy grid (Octomap), when converting to 2d occupancy grid, previously explored frontiers change to unoccupied
		1. Added hysterisis filter, now the occupied 2D gridpoints stay occupied. also added parameters that can be changed 
			1. - `occupancy_max`: The maximum occupancy value (default 100).
			2. - `hyst_threshold_high`: The high threshold ratio (e.g., 0.7).
			3. - `hyst_threshold_low`: The low threshold ratio (e.g., 0.3).
			4. **Hysteresis Logic:**  In the loop for publishing the UAV map, the code computes an absolute high and low threshold. For each cell, if the new occupancy value is between these thresholds, the code uses the previous value instead. Otherwise, it updates the cell with the new value and saves it to `prev_map_data`.
4. To build only (I just also changed the topic names a little):
```Shell
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select mapconversion
source install/setup.bash
```
5. Launch using (need Octomap_server2 running for this):
```Shell
ros2 launch mapconversion map_conversion.launch.py
```

6. To launch 2D to 3D path conversion:
```Shell
ros2 launch mapconversion path_conversion.launch.py
```


# 2.  Occupancy grid (2D) Frontier detection
## 2.1. Frontier Detection and Selection (Doesnt seem to great)

1. Using https://github.com/Nyanziba/AutoFrontierSearch_ros2-humble
	1. Check link for nodes, subscribed topics and published topics
2. Basically does following:
	1. subscribe to map, odometry and goal status(to see if goal has been reached)
	2. creates goal publisher
	3. looks at 2D occupancy grid, finds frontiers, by finding unknown calles (value -1) adjacent to at least one free cell (0)
	4. Filter out potential frontier nodes that have wall in surrounding/adjacent cell
	5. selects random frontier
	6. publishes navigation goal
	7. 5sec timer trigger (to check if goal has been reached)----this can be optimized(callback??)
3. Build and install using(folder is called AutoFrontierSearch_ros2-humble in workspace src):
```
cd
cd ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/Nyanziba/AutoFrontierSearch_ros2-humble.git
cd ..
colcon build --packages-select frontier_exploration
source install/setup.bash

```

3. Launch using:
```Shell
ros2 run frontier_exploration exploration_node
```


## 2.2. DIY Frontier Detection (2D for 3D)

1. Create package
```Shell
cd
cd ros2_ws/src
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake frontier_detection_twod --dependencies rclcpp nav_msgs geometry_msgs std_msgs
cd frontier_detection_twod/src
touch frontier_detection_twod_node.cpp #create c++ node file
```
2. Add code to frontier_detection_twod_node.cpp file
3. Update CMakeLists.txt and package.xml to add dependencies and packages to be build, the build using:
```Shell
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select frontier_detection_twod
source install/setup.bash
```
4. Run code using:
```Shell
cd ~/ros2_ws
ros2 run frontier_detection_twod frontier_detection_twod_node
```

5. Notes:
	1. Change odom_sub from /rtabmap/odom to something else for actual drone
6. Development Notes:
	1. Seems to constantly change frontier even if not reached--->--->Done
		1. Did this every 5 sec, but I changed for odometry to be within 2m of frontier, the only determine next frontier --->--->Done
	2. change code to show frontiers --->--->Done 
	3. When converting octomap to 2d occupancy grid, wall becomes non wall....... makes quad keep on going back to already explored frontier --->--->Done (NOPE:::::::Added Hysterisis filter to code that converts voxel grid to 2d occupancy map)
		1. Maybe radius of already explored frontier that should not be revisited?--->--->Done
			1. Becomes problematic in dynamic environment--->--->Done
		2. Or can i implement something to only look at octomap built since previous frontier has been set?--->--->Done
	4. change code to compare goal pose to odometry, then update/determine next goal pose --->--->Done
		1. New problem: frontier point behind wall. have to include unreachable..............
		2. Also, dont really want to sit on frontier, but want to observe it. Maybe sit 2m away from it and face it? (but will casue problems in cluttered/small environments)
	5. Add some kind of decision/filter as to which frontier to visit next
	6. Consider orientation? as frontier basically has to be observed
	7. How to make sure frontier is actually visited and mapped?
	8.
