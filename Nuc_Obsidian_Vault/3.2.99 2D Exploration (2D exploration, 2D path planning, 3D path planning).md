# 1. Roof Problem
(problem with roof, making occupancy grid seem occupied)

1. Take pointcloud
2. remove roof
3. create occupancy grid

## 1.1. Try Octomap to 2d Occupancy grid conversion:
1. Using https://github.com/LTU-RAI/Map-Conversion-3D-Voxel-Map-to-2D-Occupancy-Map  separated roof, creates 2D map for UAV or UGV... Maybe look at paper+
	1. This gives a good 2D occupancy grid
	2. NB!!! consider changing code to make more lightweight
		1. remove slopeMap
		2. remove UGV map
	3. NOTE!!! **assumes only one level of navigable space in the map in the height axis**
2. Build using:
```
cd ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/LTU-RAI/Map-Conversion-3D-Voxel-Map-to-2D-Occupancy-Map.git
cd ..
colcon build --packages-select mapconversion_msgs
colcon build --packages-select mapconversion
source install/setup.bash
```

3. Launch using:
```Shell
ros2 launch mapconversion map_conversion.launch.py
```


## 1.2. Frontier Detection and Selection

1. Using https://github.com/Nyanziba/AutoFrontierSearch_ros2-humble
