# This week:







# General:

1. Explore mapping and path planning algorithms
2. Set up offboard_control
3. Set up launch file




# DO next:

1. Explore path planning and autonomous navigation algorithms
	1. And how they work(theory/video)
	2. Down sampling/Simplifying Maps
		1. Look at open3d. First do [voxel donwsampling](9https://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/tutorial/geometry/pointcloud.html) then continue with [point cloud outlier removal](https://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/tutorial/geometry/pointcloud_outlier_removal.html) 
			1. Might also be useful to use [Hidden Point removal](https://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/tutorial/geometry/pointcloud.html) for visualisation purposes
2. Set up offboard_control_node / autonomous flight mode
	1. Look at the following local/global planner [FAR Planner](https://github.com/MichaelFYang/far_planner/tree/humble-jazzy) 
		1. The author (Ji Zhang) has some really interesting autonomy stuff [here](https://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~zhangji/index.html)  and [here](https://www.youtube.com/@JiZhang_CMU) But not to much code is available
	2. Also [A-TARE planner](https://www.cmu-exploration.com/a-tare-planner) but I thinkis ROS1
	3. [aerial_navigation_development_environment](https://github.com/caochao39/aerial_navigation_development_environment) can apparently be used for testing, but also ROS1
3. How to save point cloud map from RVIZ
4. Nicely visualize point cloud???
	1. Look at [this](https://learngeodata.eu/visualise-massive-point-cloud-in-python/) Author also has point cloud youtube channel
5. Add VIO from SpectacularAI to EKF2 and test performance
6. Autotune ==HALF TICK
	1. Still test indoors
7. Check out [this](https://pear.wpi.edu/teaching/rbe595/fall2023.html) Hands-On Autonomous Aerial Robotics course
	1. Definitely do this course. Literally has everything on autonomous drones
### Most important things:
8. For RobMech:
	1. How to save point cloud map from RVIZ
		1. [ros2bag_tools](https://github.com/AIT-Assistive-Autonomous-Systems/ros2bag_tools/tree/master) Think its a package. put in ros2_ws and build??????
		2. [rosbag2_to_pcd](https://github.com/xmfcx/rosbag2_to_pcd) creates .pcd file for each point cloud frame.... So not too tops. Also , might only work for .mcap and not for .db3 bags
		3. [ROS2 Bag Exporter](https://github.com/Geekgineer/ros2_bag_exporter) No idea. Could work
	2. Nicely visualize point cloud???
	3. Add SpecAI VIO to EKF2 and check performance
9. Another Mapping Algorithm to test: [VDB Mapping ROS2 Package](https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/vdb_mapping_ros2) 
	1. Looks very promising















# DONE:

10. OAK-D Stuff on RBPi ==TICK
11. Raspberry Pi Headless==TICK
12. Find Power LED for lighting==TICK
	1. RMF owl had 1000Lm
13. Rosbag record with OAK-D cam ==HALF TICK
14. Visualize the position obtained from quad EKF (Install PX4 on ubuntu PC first)==HALF TICK
	1. Extract points from topic and transfer to .txt file. ==TICK
	2. Plot in matlab or similar==TICK
	3. might also want to add orientation==TICK
15. Set up oak-d on vim==TICK
	1. Then setup px4 on vim==TICK
	2. Connect FC to VIM==TICK
16. OAK-D Mount==TICK 
17. OF Mount on VIM4==TICK
18. Why OAK-D didnt work in rosbag recording ==HALF TICK
	1. CPU overload, overheat=throttle==TICK



# Things I might still do:

19. RealSense vs OAK-D comparison
20. [Ciare World Creator](https://github.com/AlexKaravaev/world-creator) (LLM-Based Gazebo Sim world creator)
21. Try write own python pipeline and script for oak-d depth cloud (look at [Python virtual environment](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/python-virtual-environments/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiArby5BhCDARIsAIJvjIRbIllTfdhCEEMJR4uLXX7DjHIxEJ2E8UbSVPzc1iFfwtRPMxo_vpcaAm7QEALw_wcB)) 
	1. [This link could be very useful. Shows how to save current view to pcd file](https://discuss.luxonis.com/d/3931-point-cloud-saving/5) 



# Things I though about but didnt end up doing:

22. Try setup realsense with vim4 again ==HALF TICK (Didnt Work)
23. Try write own python pipeline and script for oak-d depth cloud (look at [Python virtual environment](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/python-virtual-environments/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiArby5BhCDARIsAIJvjIRbIllTfdhCEEMJR4uLXX7DjHIxEJ2E8UbSVPzc1iFfwtRPMxo_vpcaAm7QEALw_wcB)) 
24. Code OWN Mapping algorithm to transform pointcloud
	1. [ROS2 Gazebo World 2D/3D Map Generator](https://medium.com/@arshad.mehmood/ros2-gazebo-world-map-generator-a103b510a7e5) 
	2. [Navigation and 3D Mapping with ROS2](https://github.com/mich-pest/ros2_navigation_stvl?tab=readme-ov-file) 
	3. [Map To Odom Publisher](https://github.com/tim-fan/map_to_odom_publisher) 
	4. Figure out how to create map frame and dynamic transform to robot
25. Visualize the position obtained from quad EKF
	1. convert from px4 ned to normal fdr or whatever it is called
26. Create Transform for mapping and test on intel realsense data set
	1. figure out pointcloud topic
	2. record point cloud and position/orientation topic
	3. transform point cloud data according to position data
	4. save to .pcd file
	5. visualise pointcloud
