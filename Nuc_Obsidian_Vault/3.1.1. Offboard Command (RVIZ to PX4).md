1. This document will describe the node created that take in a pose from the /goal_pose topic and publishes it to the /offboard_position_cmd topic
2. A pose can be inserted on RVIZ2 using the "2D Goal Pose" function at the top, this will be written to the /offboard_position_cmd topic, "position_control.py" node then publishes the pose to /fmu/in/trajectory_setpoint topic for the quad to move there

# 1. Creating python ROS2 node (Adding to  voidraven_offboard package):
1. Create file, and make executable:
```Shell
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/voidraven_offboard/voidraven_offboard
touch publish_pose_to_topic.py
chmod +x publish_pose_to_topic.py
```
2. Add code to ~/ros2_ws/src/voidraven_offboard/voidraven_offboard/publish_pose_to_topic.py
3. Add following to setup.py in ~/ros2_ws/ros2_ws/src/voidraven_offboard/setup.py:
```Shell
entry_points={
    'console_scripts': [
        'publish_pose_to_topic = voidraven_offboard.publish_pose_to_topic:main'
    ],
},
```
4. Also add following to package.xml, if not there already:
```Shell
<exec_depend>rclpy</exec_depend>
<exec_depend>geometry_msgs</exec_depend>
```
5. Build package:
```Shell
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select voidraven_offboard
source install/setup.bash
```
6. Run code(was also running voidraven_offboard.launch.py, RTABMap, Octomap, mapconversion and RVIZ2):
```Shell
cd ~/ros2_ws
ros2 run voidraven_offboard publish_pose_to_topic
```


7. Notes: 
	1. When inputting "2D Goal Pose" in RTABMap, z position is 0, so I just hardcode offset it by 2 for now
	2. Also add local planer later
	3. Should be quite lightweight, but if it consumes too much processing power, combine the "publish_pose_to_topic" and "position_control" nodes
