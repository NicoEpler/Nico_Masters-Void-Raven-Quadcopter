	1. Could be useful but idk if it runs on ROS2
	2. Might not be designed for real time performance

# 1. This works (Not Recommended):
1. After installing DepthAI packages/repositories
2. Install RTABMAP according to [this page](https://docs.luxonis.com/software/ros/depthai-ros/driver/)
3. Also install missing dependencies
4. run RTABMap using:
```Shell
ros2 launch depthai_ros_driver rtabmap.launch.py
```



# 2. This works (Recommended) (From source) (Tested on RBPi 4B and Vim4)

## 2.1. Install DepthAI from source
1. go to 2.1. Setup of companion computer" and follow "3.2.4.2. To Install DepthAI from Source (Recommended)"

## 2.2. Install RTABMAP

 1. Install RTABMap
```Shell
sudo apt install ros-humble-rtabmap-ros
```
	you will probably get error message due to missing dependencies. Install these dependenccies using "sudo apt install ......" and run above command again
	

### 2.2.1. Running RTABMAP through DepthAI (Not recommended)

1. Adding RTABMAP through DepthAI from here: https://docs.luxonis.com/software/ros/depthai-ros/driver/
2. Launch RTAB-MAP using:
```Shell
ros2 launch depthai_ros_driver rtabmap.launch.py
```

4. Add following to .bashrc file (modify if vim4/device has different name):
```Shell
source /home/khadas/dai_ws/install/setup.bash
```

5. After doing changes to the rtabmap code in /home/dronepi/dai_ws/src/depthai-ros-humble/depthai_ros_driver/launch/rtabmap.launch.py , do the following:
	1. Changes made to file can be found in github repo in "/void-raven-quadcopter/Altered_Simulation_Files/RTAB-Map Installation" You can simply replace the original file with this file
	2. rtabmap.launch.pycomes from /home/khadas/dai_ws/src/depthai-ros/depthai_ros_driver/launch
    Also maybe add "--packages-select depthai_ros_driver"

```Shell
cd
cd dai_ws
MAKEFLAGS="-j1 -l1" colcon build --packages-select depthai_ros_driver
source install/setup.bash
```

99. LaunchRTAB-MAP using:
```Shell
ros2 launch depthai_ros_driver rtabmap.launch.py
```

### 2.2.2. Running RTABMap and DepthAI camera node seperately

1. try launching rtabmap and camera seperately, as follows
2. Note the changes to 
	1. camera.launch.py file, else once you subscribe to the rectified image topic, the camera node crashes). Maybe this has something to do with running in/from container? Also rtabmap.launch.py file 'approx_sync:=true' causes problems:
		1. camera.launch.py comes from /home/khadas/dai_ws/src/depthai-ros/depthai_ros_driver/launch 
	2. Take files from github repo "/void-raven-quadcopter/Altered_Simulation_Files/RTAB-Map Installation" and use these to replace original files. to know what files to replace and where to place them, red the readme file in the "/void-raven-quadcopter/Altered_Simulation_Files/RTAB-Map Installation" directory
		1. So basically, Copy files from "RTAB-Map Istallation" into directory specified in ReadMe file

3. After doing changes to camera.launch.py, rebuild workspace
```Shell
cd
cd dai_ws
MAKEFLAGS="-j1 -l1" colcon build --packages-select depthai_ros_driver
source install/setup.bash
```

4. To run, run the following to launch each node individually (camera and RTABmap):
	1. launch camera node
```Shell
ros2 launch depthai_ros_driver camera.launch.py
```
	2. launch rtabmap from rtabmap binaries instead of DepthAI
```Shell
ros2 launch rtabmap_launch rtabmap.launch.py  args:="--delete_db_on_start"  depth_topic:=/oak/stereo/image_raw  rgb_topic:=/oak/rgb/image_raw  camera_info_topic:=/oak/rgb/camera_info  frame_id:=oak-d-base-frame  use_sim_time:=true approx_sync:=true  qos:=2  queue_size:=30
```

4. To make it easier, create a launch file to launch camera and RTABMap seperately, but with single command
	1. Take "rtabmap_custom" folder from github repo in "/void-raven-quadcopter/Altered_Simulation_Files/RTAB-Map Installation" and place it inside "~/ros2_ws/src"
	2. colcon build and launch using:
```Shell
cd
cd ros2_ws/
colcon build --packages-select rtabmap_custom
ros2 launch rtabmap_custom rtabmap_custom.launch.py
```
