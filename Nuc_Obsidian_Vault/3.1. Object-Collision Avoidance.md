If using a companion computer or external sensor, it needs to supply a stream of [OBSTACLE_DISTANCE](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#OBSTACLE_DISTANCE) messages, which should reflect when and where obstacle were detected.
The minimum rate at which messages _must_ be sent depends on vehicle speed - at higher rates the vehicle will have a longer time to respond to detected obstacles. Initial testing of the system used a vehicle moving at 4 m/s with `OBSTACLE_DISTANCE` messages being emitted at 10Hz (the maximum rate supported by the vision system). The system may work well at significantly higher speeds and lower frequency distance updates.
