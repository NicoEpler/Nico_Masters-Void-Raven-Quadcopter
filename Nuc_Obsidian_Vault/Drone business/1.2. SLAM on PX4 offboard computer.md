# 1. Pose and Velocity Estimation

1. [Optical Flow](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/sensor/optical_flow.html) provides 2D velocity estimation (using a downward facing camera and a downward facing distance sensor)
2. [Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO)](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/computer_vision/visual_inertial_odometry.html) provides 3D pose and velocity estimation using an onboard vision system and IMU. It is used for navigation when global position information is absent or unreliable.


# 2. Collision Avoidance + Path Planning

1. [Collision Prevention](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/computer_vision/collision_prevention.html) is used to stop vehicles before they can crash into an obstacle (primarily when flying in manual modes).





# 3. SLAM with D435i

1. Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcJHnHpwCXk&ab_channel=IntelRealSense) where the source code can bee found [here](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros/wiki/SLAM-with-D435i) 
2. Only Problem:
	1. Doesn't do path planning and collision avoidance







# 99. Strategy for implementation:

1. Use SLAM with D435i section and get slam to work
2. Check if this can work with collision avoidance from PX4
3. Find a way to perform path planning and deploy aswell
4.
