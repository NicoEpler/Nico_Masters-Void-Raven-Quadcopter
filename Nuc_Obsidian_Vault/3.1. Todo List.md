1. OAK-D Stuff on RBPi ==TICK
2. Raspberry Pi Headless==TICK
3. Find Power LED for lighting==TICK
	1. RMF owl had 1000Lm



1. Rosbag record with OAK-D cam ==HALF TICK
2. Visualize the position obtained from quad EKF (Install PX4 on ubuntu PC first)==HALF TICK
3. Set up oak-d on vim==TICK
	1. Then setup px4 on vim
4. Try setup realsense with vim4 again ==HALF TICK 
5. Try write own python pipeline and script for oak-d depth cloud
6. OAK-D Mount
7. RealSense vs OAK-D comparison
8. Why OAK-D didnt work in rosbag recording ==HALF TICK
	1. CPU overload, overheat=throttle
9. 
10. Code Mapping algorithm to transform pointcloud

	3. [Map To Odom Publisher](https://github.com/tim-fan/map_to_odom_publisher) 
11. Figure out how to create map frame and dynamic transform to robot
12. Explore mapping and path planning algorithms
13. Raspberry pi power cable
14. Raspberry Pi launch file for headless
	1. Can also consider loading ubuntu headless/server onto pi, as I dont need Realsense D435i working anymore
